# Aliter.tmbundle

A **TextMate bundle** for the [**Aliter**](http://github.com/aliter/aliter) Ragnarok Online server emulator, specifically targeting its scripting engine. It is a fork of the [**Elixir**](http://github.com/josevalim/elixir programming language's [TextMate bundle](http://github.com/josevalim/elixir-tmbundle) as Aliter's scripting engine is based on it.

## Installation

### TextMate

    mkdir -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles
    cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles
    git clone git://github.com/aliter/aliter-tmbundle Aliter.tmbundle

### Sublime Text 2

Sublime Text 2 does read `.tmbundle` files, so you can follow the same process outlined below:

    mkdir -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages/Aliter
    cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages/Aliter
    git clone git://github.com/aliter/aliter-tmbundle Aliter.tmbundle

The bundle is still in development and includes syntax highlighting. Contributions and extensions are welcome!
